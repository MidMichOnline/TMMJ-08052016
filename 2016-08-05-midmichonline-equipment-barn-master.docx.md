# SYF Purchases New Equipment Barn

From the [Shepherd Youth Football Program](https://www.facebook.com/Shepherdyouthfootball/photos/a.1256944597683555.1073741842.287401244637900/1256952601016088/?type=3):

Thanks to the generous support of our donors and bowlers at our bowling tournament this past spring, we were able to purchase SYF's new equipment barn. We are thankful for the relationship that we have with the school that allows us to put it on school grounds. A BIG THANK YOU to Rick, Lucas, & Noah Judge, Nate Ferency, Nate Buckner, and Brent Curtiss for getting the barn in place!
